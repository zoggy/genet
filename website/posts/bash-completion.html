<p>Some notes about how bash completion is provided for the genet command line tool.</p>
<sep_/>
<p>
One of the first demands of the first Genet users was
about adding command line completion when using the
<code>genet</code> command line tool. Indeed, this
tool accepts subcommands (like git, or svn), and even
subsubcommands (for example <code>genet add port</code>).
</p>
<p>
The first thing I did was to read about bash completion
(starting with <ext-a href="http://blog.greweb.fr/2009/10/bash-completion/">this
post</ext-a>). Then I had a look at how git completion is implemented
(in file <code>/etc/bash_completion.d/git</code> on my Debian).
</p>
<p>
At this point, looking at all this bash code, two questions came to
my mind:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I <strong>really</strong> have to do it in bash ?</li>
<li>Do I <strong>really</strong> have to modify the code when
I change the command line arguments and subcommands ?</li>
</ul>
<p>
Instead, I chose another way: Since I had already coded a <code>Cmdline</code>
module to handle subcommands when parsing command line arguments,
the subcommands and their options were already represented in my code.
What was missing was a function taking the current command line and
returning a list of choices of what was possible next, to provide completion
facility.
</p>
<p>
So, the <a href="../genet-bash-completion.sh"><code>genet-bash-completion.sh</code></a>
file is rather simple:
</p>
<hcode lang="bash" defer_="1"><include raw="true" file="../genet-bash-completion.sh"/></hcode>
<p>
Almost all the work is done by the <code>genet-cheat</code> tool, taking as argument
the position of the currently edited argument and the current command line.
</p>
<p>
From this information and the command line specification, the <code>Cmdline.completion</code>
function walks through the command line specification according to the current command line arguments.
When the argument currently edited is reached, the function returns a structure
indicating what can be used to complete the argument.
</p>
<p>This structure has the following form (at the time I write this post):</p>
<ocaml>
type completion_choices =
  { compl_words : string list ;
    compl_files : bool ;
    compl_xfiles : string option ;
  }
</ocaml>
<p>
The field <code>compl_words</code> is used to indicate a list of possible words
to complete the current argument. From this field, the <code>genet-cheat</code>
tool will issue a <code>-W "word1 word2 ..."</code> string. This tells
<code>compgen</code> to use the given list of words as possible choices.
</p>
<p>If the field <code>compl_files</code> is set to <code>true</code>, then
the <code>genet-cheat</code> tool will also issue a <code>-f</code> string;
this makes <code>compgen</code> propose filename completion.
</p>
<p>At last, if a pattern is given in the field <code>compl_xfiles</code>, then
<code>-X "pattern"</code> is also printed by <code>genet-cheat</code>.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the work is achieved by the <code>compgen</code> bash internal function.
</p>
<p>
If my previous command line specification contained enough information to complete
options and subcommands names, some information was missing: how to complete
(1) option arguments and (2) anonymous arguments ?
</p>
<p>
In my previous command line specification, I used the <code>Arg.spec</code> type
provided by the OCaml <code>Arg</code> module to describe options. So I was
able to know whether an option takes an argument or not, which was required to
be able to provide contextual completion, i.e. do not propose an option name if the
current edited argument is after an option requiring an argument.
</p>
<p>
So I added a new <code>Cmdline.spec</code> type, on the same form as <code>Arg.spec</code>,
excepts that some construtors take an additional argument: a function returning
a <code>completion_choices</code> structure. Here is a part of the definition of this
<code>Cmdline.spec</code> type:
</p>
<ocaml><![CDATA[
type completion_fun = (unit -> completion_choices)
type completion_opt = completion_fun option
type spec =
  | Unit of (unit -> unit)
  ...
  | String of completion_opt * (string -> unit)
  | Set_string of completion_opt * string Pervasives.ref
  | Int of completion_opt * (int -> unit)
  ...
]]></ocaml>
<p>
Now with this information, when the current edited argument is the argument of
an option, the completion function is called to retrieve the choices to propose
to the user. This solves problem (1).
</p>
<p>
To tackle problem (2), the <code>Cmdline.completion</code> function needed some
information about anonymous arguments. I added a field in command description
to store a value of the following new type:
</p>
<ocaml>
type completion_spec =
  | Complist of completion_fun
  | Compfun of completion_fun
;;
</ocaml>
<p>
With this type, I can indicate the list of expected arguments for a command
by a list of values of type <code>completion_spec</code>.
</p>
<p>When the currently edited argument corresponds to an anonymous argument,
the <code>completion</code> function can use the corresponding function
to return the choices to propose to the user.
</p>
<p>
An example of the result is shown <elt href="doc-bash-completion#example">here</elt>.
</p>
<p>
With this solution, I don't need to maintain the bash completion script
consistent to the OCaml code. All is done from the command line specification,
which is used to parse command line arguments in the <code>genet</code> tool
and used by the <code>genet-cheat</code> tool to provide completion.
Should I modify subcommands or options, I don't have to worry about
completion. I just have to provide <code>completion_fun</code>s,
and OCaml will not compile if I forget to fill the corresponding field.
</p>
<p>
The only possible problem I can encounter is to forget to update completion
functions for anonymous arguments. Well, I think that's a good compromise
compared to the work required to provide and maintain the same facility
with bash code.

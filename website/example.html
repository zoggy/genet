This page describes the set up of a simple project, step by step.
All required tools and files are available in the Genet distribution,
in directory <icode>website/example</icode>.

<section id="intro" title="Introduction">
<p>The example project, called "genet-example", defines three tools:
</p>
<ul>
<li><icode>split-text</icode> to split text files into words,</li>
<li><icode>words</icode> to keep only unique words,</li>
<li><icode>average</icode> to compute the average length of a list of lines.</li>
</ul>
<p>
These tools can be used together to compute the average length of words
in texts (do not forget this is for an example project, for a pedagogical
purpose):

<p>
We will show how to use Genet to set up a continuous integration environment
for our project.
</p>
<p class="alert alert-warning">
The <icode>genet</icode> tools must be in our path.
The output of commands is not shown. You are encouraged to type
the commands of the example to get familiar with Genet.
</p>
</section>

<section id="init" title="Initialisation">
<subsection id="createdb" title="Create the database">
<p>The first thing to do is create the database. Here we use
a MySQL database called <icode>genet_example</icode>:
</p>
<sh>
$ mysql -u root -p
mysql> create database genet_example;
mysql> grant all privileges on genet_example.* to genet@localhost;
</sh>
</subsection>

<subsection id="init-dir" title="Create the project directory">
<p>
Then we have to create the directory of our project, in <icode>/tmp/genet-example</icode>.
The structure of this directory is described
<elt href="doc-user#setup:init-dir">here</elt>. To do so,
we use the <icode>genet</icode> tool. At last, we make <icode>/tmp/genet-example/in</icode> a git repository:
</p>
<incsh id="initdir"/>
</subsection>

<subsection id="createconfig" title="Setup the configuration file">
<p>
The initialization of the directory creates a default <icode>config.txt</icode> file
in the project directory.
It contains information regarding the project name, database connection and
web interface. We edit this file to:
</p>
<ocaml defer_="1"><include file="./example/config.txt" raw="true"/></ocaml>
</subsection>

<subsection id="init-db" title="Initialize the project database">
<p>
Next we initialize the database tables:
</p>
<incsh id="initdb"/>
</subsection>

<subsection id="change-dir" title="Change to the project directory">
<p>
For the next operations, we change to the project directory, so that
we do not have to use the <icode>--config</icode> option, as by default
the <icode>config.txt</icode> file of the current directory is used:
</p>
<incsh id="changedir"/>
</subsection>

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>
At this point, you can launch the web server to browse your project. Just run
</p>
<sh>$ genet-rest</sh>
<p>and visit <ext-a href="http://localhost:8082/"><icode>http://localhost:8082/</icode></ext-a>.
</p>
</div>
</section>

<section id="filetypes" title="Defining filetypes">
<p>
Then, we have to define filetypes, to represent the types of files
read and produced by our project's tools. Each filetype has an id,
a file extension and a description.Here, we have three filetypes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>text files, with <icode>.txt</icode> extension,</li>
<li>words files, with <icode>.txt</icode> extension, with a word on each line,</li>
<li>number files, with <icode>.nb</icode> extension, containing only a string representing a float number.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following commands will create the filetypes:</p>
<incsh id="addfiletypes"/>
<p class="alert alert-info">
<icode>genet add</icode> commands usually returns the url of the newly created item.
Each item has its own unique url, used as identifier in other commands.
Moreover, these urls can be used in the web interface to access the items; the items
are resources, which can be refered to in RDF graphs, for example.
</p>
<p>We can use the <icode>genet query</icode> subcommand to list filetypes:</p>
<incsh id="showfiletypes"/>
</section>

<section id="tools" title="Adding tools">
<p>
The next step is to define our three tools in our project.
The term "tool" must be taken in the broad sense: it can be an executable or a whole
software, project or package providing various tools (executables).
For each tool, we can define branches, versions and interfaces. Interfaces are commands
associated to a tool, a specific branch or a specific version. Interfaces
are used to represent:
</p>
<ul>
<li> the various behaviours of an executable depending on command line options,</li>
<li> the various executables provided by a tool (where a "tool" or software is composed
of various executables).</li>
</ul>
<p>Each interface has a command-line attached. This command will be run when executing
a chain where this interface appears (see below). In the provided command line,
<icode>%v</icode> will be replaced by the tool version. This allows to have various
versions of a tool installed in places differing only by the version number in the
command line path.
</p>
<p>
For our example project, we'll act like if our three tools are developped separately,
and so their version numbers are independent. Each of our tools is composed of only
one executable.
</p>
<div id="makeinstalltools" class="alert alert-info">
<p>To install the tools, go to the <icode>website/example</icode> directory
of the Genet distribution and type
</p>
<sh>$ make install</sh>
<p>This will install tools in the <icode>/tmp/tools</icode> directory. </p>
</div>
<subsection id="splittext" title="Adding the split-text tool">
<p>We start by defining our <icode>split-text</icode> tool. We show the output
in comment, because it is used from one command to another:</p>
<incsh id="addsplittexttool"/>
<p>We then add a <icode>O.x</icode> branch:</p>
<incsh id="addsplittextbranch"/>
<p>In this branch, we define a <icode>0.1</icode> version:</p>
<incsh id="addsplittextversion"/>
<p>Then, we define a new interface, associated to the tool, which means this interface
will be supported by all versions of the tool. We could have defined the interface
only for a branch; in this case, all the versions "under" the branch would have
offered the interface. We could also associate an interface to a specific version.
Note here the <icode>-p</icode> option used to provide the command line of this interface:
</p>
<incsh id="addsplittextintf"/>
<p>Next, we add two ports to this interface, one for input and one for output. Each port
has an associated type, so that some controls will be done when defining treatment chains.
</p>
<p>
Let's add an input port ("in") for our interface, by giving a filetype id ("text"):
</p>
<incsh id="addsplittextin"/>
<p>
Then we add an output port ("out"), with another filetype id ("words").
</p>
<incsh id="addsplittextout"/>
<p>
When the command associated to the interface will be run, it will be given, in this order,
the list of input arguments (files and/or directories) and the list of output arguments
(files and/or directories). Here our interface command will take two parameters: an
input file and an output file.
</p>
<p>
We can list the available interfaces with the following command.
By now, this will list the only interface we defined at this point:
</p>
<incsh id="showinterfaces"/>

</subsection>

<subsection id="words" title="Adding the words tool">
<p>
We define the "words" tool the same way as above, except that some commands below
use the output of previous commands to avoid typing the urls of created items:
</p>
<incsh id="addwords"/>
</subsection>

<subsection id="average" title="Adding the average tool">
<p>
Then, we do the same to define the "average" tool with one interface:
</p>
<incsh id="addaverage"/>
</subsection>

</section>

<section id="chains" title="Defining a chain">
<p>
The next step is to define a chain, that is a data flow composed of interfaces,
whose input will be a test case (see below).
For our project, we will define one chain using our three tools.
</p>
<p>
A chain is defined in a chain module; a chain module is defined in a
<icode>.gnt</icode> file, in the <icode>in/chains/</icode> directory
of our Genet project.
</p>
<p>Here we define a <icode>Test</icode> module, with only one chain,
called <icode>words_avg_length</icode>. The fullname of the chain is then
<icode>Test.words_avg_length</icode>.
To do so, we type the following code in the
<icode>in/chains/test.gnt</icode> file:
</p>
<hcode lang-file="genet.lang" defer_="1"><include file="./example/in/chains/test.gnt" raw="true"/></hcode>
<p>
Revisions of chains are handled with git. So we add our chain file to git:
</p>
<incsh id="gitaddchain"/>
<p>
We can check our chain by visiting its url
<ext-a href="http://localhost:8082/chains/Test/words_avg_length"><icode>http://localhost:8082/chains/Test/words_avg_length</icode></ext-a> or just test the syntax with the following command:
</p>
<incsh id="testchain"/>
</section>

<section id="input" title="Defining an input">
<p>An input is a set of data and a list of chains to apply to the data.
A pair (data, chain) can be considered as a test case.
</p>
<p>
Now we will define such an input. The data will be a simple text file.
The chain to apply will be <icode>Test.words_avg_length</icode> we defined
above.
</p>
<p>
Inputs are placed in <icode>in/data/</icode>, with one directory by input.
The input is described in the <icode>spec.in</icode> file. Other files
and directories in the input directory can be referenced from the
<icode>spec.in</icode> file to be used an input data for the chains to apply.
</p>
<p>
Let's create a <icode>test1</icode> directory under <icode>in/data/</icode>:
</p>
<sh>$ mkdir in/data/test1</sh>
<p>
Then, let's copy a text file, for example
<a href="example/in/data/test1/sue.txt">this one</a>. Next, we create
the <icode>in/data/test1/spec.in</icode> file with the following
contents:
</p>
<hcode lang-file="genet.lang" defer_="1"><include file="./example/in/data/test1/spec.in" raw="true"/></hcode>
<p>
Revisions of inputs are also handled by git, so we add these two files
to git:
</p>
<incsh id="gitaddinput"/>
</section>

<section id="flattening" title="Flattening chains">
<p>
Before being able to apply a chain on an input, the chain must be flattened.
Indeed, each chain operation can refer to an interface (as in our example) or
another chain. So we need to flatten the chain to have only reference to interfaces.
Moreover, flattening the chain will give us a stable reference to chain, associated
to the git ids of the source chains it was built from.
</p>
<p>
To flatten our <icode>Test.words_avg_length</icode> chain, let's just run
the following command:
</p>
<incsh id="flattenchain"/>
</section>

<section id="inst" title="Executing chains">
<p>
Now that we have defined an input and flattened the chain it refers to,
we can execute this flattened chain to obtained instanciated chains.
</p>
<p>
Each flattened chain can give various instanciated chains. Each instanciated
chain corresponds to a combination of versions of the tools used in the chain.
So, if a chain uses interfaces from two different tools, T1 and T2, with
T1 having three versions and T2 two versions, then 3 x 2 instanciated chains
are possible.
</p>
<p>
By now, we have only one version per tool, so we will get only one instanciation
chain, by running the following command. We indicate to execute chains on
the <icode>test1</icode> input:
</p>
<incsh id="execchain"/>
<p>
The flattened chain executed is the last chain flattened from the chain specified
in the input. The instanciated chain can be browsed using the form at
<ext-a href="http://localhost:8082/inst-chains"><icode>http://localhost:8082/inst-chains</icode></ext-a>.
</p>
<p>
If we're satisfied with the result of the execution, we can set this
instanciated chain as a reference for this input and this source chain:
</p>
<sh>$ genet add refinst test1 Test.words_avg_length \
  http://localhost:8082/inst-chains/Test/words_avg_length/...
</sh>
</section>

<section id="newwords" title="A new version of the words tool">
<p>
Now suppose we developped and installed a new version of the "words" tool, version 0.4,
which lowercases all words. We want to re-run our <icode>test1</icode>.
</p>
<p>
First, we add this new version:
</p>
<incsh id="addnewwords"/>
<p>
Since this version is under the 0.x branch, it means that the <icode>unique-words</icode>
interface is provided by this new version. Then, we can execute our test, and this
new version of the tool will be used when computing the combinations of tools
to use to execute the last chain flattened from <icode>Test.words_avg_length</icode>:
</p>
<incsh id="execchain"/>
</section>
<section id="diffs" title="Comparing executions">
<p>
Then, we can compare this new instanciated chain with the reference instanciated chain:
</p>
<sh>$ genet diff http://localhost:8082/inst-chains/Test/words_avg_length/...</sh>
<p>
<icode>genet diff</icode> can be given two instanciated chain urls to compare
the output of any instanciated chains. If only one is given, it compares against the reference
instanciated chain, for the same input and source chain of the instanciated chain
given on command line.
</p>
<p>
The web interface provides a form to compare two executions:
  <ext-a href="http://localhost:8082/diff/inst-chains"><icode>http://localhost:8082/diff/inst-chains</icode></ext-a>
</p>
<p>
The <icode>--url-if-diff</icode> option of <icode>genet diff</icode>
prints a url to the comparison results if there is a difference. This is useful for example
to nightly compare new executions with reference executions, and send an email with
the url of differences, if any.
</p>
<p>
The default diff command used to compare execution results can be specified in two ways.
First, one can use the <icode>--diff</icode> option of <icode>genet diff</icode> to specify
a command to run, instead of the default one (<icode>diff -r -u</icode>).
</p>
<p>
Another way is to define a diff command associated to a name, using the following command:
</p>
<incsh id="adddiffcommand"/>
<p>
Then, the name <icode>mydiff</icode> can be given to the <icode>--diff</icode> option
of <icode>genet diff</icode>, to use the associated command.
</p>
<p class="alert alert-warning">
Note that the web interface does not allow using arbitrary diff command, for security reasons.
Only predefined diff commands added with <icode>genet add diff-command</icode> can be used.
</p>
</section>

<section id="newaverage" title="A new version of the average tool">
<p>
Now suppose we developped and installed a new version of our "average" tool,
which removes the extrema values before computing the average.
</p>
<p>Let's add this new version:</p>
<incsh id="addnewaverage"/>
<p>
Now, if we ask for execution of chains for the <icode>test1</icode> input, we will
have 1 x 2 x 2 combinations of tool versions, i.e. 4 instanciated chains. Two have already
been executed, so the following command will trigger the execution of the two remaining
combinations:
</p>
<incsh id="execchain"/>
<p>
<icode>genet diff</icode> can also be used to compare not only execution final results, but also
intermediate command results. In the web interface, when looking at an instanciated chain,
you can click on a chain node to get its url.
You can then give two of these urls to <icode>genet diff</icode> to compare, for example,
the outputs of the "words/unique-words" in two executions.
</p>
</section>

<section id="activeversion" title="Active versions">
<p>
With time, the number of tool versions will increase, and so the number
of combinations of versions used to execute chains. If a new version of each
tool is added each night to perform tests with last changes, this can lead to
a lot of executions stored in database, most of them not being relevant.
</p>
<p>
To prevent this problem, a tool version can be flagged as active or not.
By default, it is active, i.e. it is used when computing the various tool
version combinations to use. A command allows to set a version as inactive,
for example here we set version 0.2 of <icode>words</icode> as inactive:
</p>
<incsh id="setactive"/>
<p>
If we have scripts adding new versions each night to run our tests, we
can use the following algorithm in these scripts:
</p>
<ol>
<li>checkout, compile and install new versions of our tools,</li>
<li>add new versions of tools in Genet, for example using the git id
  as version number,</li>
<li>run the tests, i.e. create instanciated chains with the new combinations
of tool versions (as we did with <icode>genet exec test1</icode>),</li>
<li>set the new versions of tools as inactive, so that they won't be used
next night.</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section id="scripts" title="Using scripts">
<p>
The various <icode>genet</icode> subcommands can be used in scripts to perform
nightly actions. See the reference documentation.

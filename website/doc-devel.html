<section id="sources" title="Organisation of source code">
<p>
Source code is versionned with
<ext-a href="http://www.git-scm.com">Git</ext-a> on Github:
 <ext-a href="https://github.com/zoggy/genet">https://github.com/zoggy/genet</ext-a>.
</p>
<p>
The code is organised as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li><icode>/utils</icode>: utilities for compilation.</li>
<li><icode>/doc</icode>: files used to generate documentation,
  including OCamldoc and the RDF vocabulary.</li>
<li><icode>/website</icode>: web site sources, including the documentation.
  The site is generated with <ext-a href="http://zoggy.github.com/stog/">Stog</ext-a>.</li>
<li><icode>/src</icode>: OCaml source code for executables and some templates:
  <ul>
  <li><icode>/base</icode>: base library, with modules used by other parts of the code.</li>
  <li><icode>/chains</icode>: handling chains (parsing, flattening, storing, executing, ...).</li>
  <li><icode>/driver</icode>: main programs and additional modules shared among these
  programs (options and command line management, ...).</li>
  <li><icode>/grdf</icode>: semantic graph manipulation (storing, modifying, querying, ...).</li>
  <li><icode>/gui</icode>: source code of GUI.</li>
  <li><icode>/indata</icode>: management of input files (reading, writing).</li>
  <li><icode>/rest</icode>: REST interface, including web interface.</li>
  <li><icode>/tests</icode>: some test files.</li>
  <li><icode>/tmpl</icode>: templates used in web interface (XML files used with Xtmpl).</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><icode>/draft</icode>: some notes, figures, test files, ...
  <ul>
    <li><icode>/proval</icode>: test scripts using tools from the Proval/Toccata team.</li>

<subsection id="chains:def" title="Definition of chains">
<p>
Chains are described with a domain specific language (DSL), using the common
lexer from <refdoc mod="Lexer"/> and the parser defined in <refdoc mod="Chn_parser"/>.
The resulting structure is defined in <refdoc mod="Chn_ast"/>.
</p>
</subsection>
<subsection id="chains:flatten" title="Flattening chains">
<p>
Before applying a chain, i.e. running the commands associated to the interfaces
used in the chain definition, the chain must be flattened, that is all the
referenced chains are recursively replaced by their dataflow definition, composed
of interfaces and references to other chains. At the end of the flattening,
the final chain, called a "flat chain", contains only references to interfaces.
</p>
<p>The flattening is performed by <refdoc mod="Chn_flat" val="flatten"/>.</p>
<p>
When a chain is flattened, the flat chain is stored in the model, with
a reference to the original chain and its git id. If the chain source file
was not commited or not handled by git, then the flat chain is not stored.
</p>
<p>
When a chain is referenced from the chain to flatten, the referenced chain
is flattened (and stored in the model), then this flat chain is used to
replace the original reference. So the flattening is done "bottom-up".
</p>
<p>
When the special construction <code>foreach</code> is used (see
<elt href="example2#addchain">this example</elt>), "Explode" and "Implode"
nodes are added, to represent the distribution and gathering of data to and from
the repeated operations.
</p>
<p>The flattening process also checks types of connected ports of interfaces
to make sure they are compatible.
</p>
</subsection>
<subsection id="chains:run" title="Running chains">
<p>
Running a chain is also called instanciating a chain, as the interfaces used
in the chain are instanciated with a combination of the versions of the
corresponding tools.
</p>
<p>The instanciation is perform by the <refdoc mod="Chn_inst" val="instanciate"/> function.
</p>
<p>
If the same chain is already instanciated for the same input and the same tool
version combination, then it is not re-instanciated, except if the <code>force</code>
parameter is set to <code>true</code>. In this case, the previous instanciation
is removed from the database and the flat chain is executed again.
</p>
<p>
Instanciated chains are linked to the original flat chain, the input data (i.e.
the input directory and its git id), and the combination of versions of the various
tools involved in the chain definition.
</p>
<p>
Instanciation is performed in a transaction: if an unexpected error occurs, a rollback
is performed. An execution error of one of the interfaces is not considered as an
unexpected error: the execution error is recorded and the instanciated chain is
simply not complete.

    Since the "split" operation will produce a set of text, we want as many
    "count" operations as "text" outputs from "split". The "foreach" construction
    will change the type of the first input port of "count" from "x" to "x set",
    and its output type from "y" to "y set". Here "x" is "text" and "y" is "number".
   Parameter 1 of "foreach" indicates to iterate on first input port.
